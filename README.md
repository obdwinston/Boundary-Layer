Basic program to compute airfoil skin friction coefficient using von Karman's integral momentum equation and empirical boundary layer data. Thwaites' and Head's methods used for laminar and turbulent boundary layers respectively. Squire-Young formula used to estimate profile drag coefficient. Inviscid solution computed with linear vortex panel method.
